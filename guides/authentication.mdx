## Overview

ZipKit uses **Bearer token authentication** for all API requests. Access tokens are created within your project dashboard and provide secure access to the API.

## Creating an Access Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Access Tokens">
    Log in to your ZipKit dashboard and select your project. Go to the "Access Tokens" section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new token">
    1. Click the "Create Token" button
    2. Click "Create"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your token">
    **Important**: Copy the token immediately! For security reasons, you won't be able to see it again after leaving this page.

    If you lose a token, you'll need to create a new one and update any applications using the old token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Access Token

Include your access token in the `Authorization` header of every API request using the Bearer scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": ["https://example.com/file.pdf"],
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rotate tokens regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    For enhanced security, rotate your access tokens periodically:

    1. Create a new token
    2. Update your application to use the new token
    3. Verify the new token works
    4. Delete the old token
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store tokens securely" icon="lock">
    **Never** commit tokens to version control or expose them in client-side code.

    ✅ **Do:**
    - Store tokens in environment variables
    - Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
    - Keep tokens in secure configuration files excluded from version control

    ❌ **Don't:**
    - Hardcode tokens in your application code
    - Commit tokens to Git repositories
    - Share tokens in plain text via email or messaging apps
    - Include tokens in client-side JavaScript
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit token distribution" icon="users">
    Only create as many tokens as you need, and keep track of where each token is used. This makes it easier to audit access and revoke tokens when necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor token usage" icon="chart-line">
    Keep track of which tokens are actively being used. If you see unexpected API calls, you may need to rotate your tokens.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Tokens

### Listing Tokens

You can view all access tokens for a project in the dashboard. The token list shows:
- Masked token (e.g., `1icNY**************Ida8` - showing first and last few characters)
- Creation date

The full token value is **never** displayed after initial creation.

### Revoking Tokens

To revoke a token:

1. Go to the "Access Tokens" section
2. Find the token you want to revoke
3. Click "Delete"
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Revoking a token is **immediate** and **irreversible**. Any applications using that token will immediately lose API access.
</Warning>

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

You'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response if:

- No `Authorization` header is provided
- The token is invalid or has been revoked
- The token format is incorrect (not using `Bearer` scheme)

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing access token"
}
```

**Solution**: Check that you're including the correct `Authorization` header with a valid token.

### 403 Forbidden

You'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response if:

- You're trying to access a resource from a different project
- The token doesn't have permission for the requested operation

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "error": "forbidden",
  "message": "Access denied to this resource"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify you're using the correct token for the project, and that the resource ID belongs to that project.

## Security Considerations

<Note>
  **Token Security**: Access tokens provide full access to your project's API. Treat them like passwords:

  - Never share tokens publicly
  - Revoke tokens immediately if compromised
  - Use HTTPS for all API requests (never HTTP)
  - Implement token rotation policies for production systems
</Note>
