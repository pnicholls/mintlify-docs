## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when your zip creation jobs complete. Instead of polling the status endpoint, ZipKit will automatically send an HTTP POST request to your specified URL when a zip finishes processing.

## Why Use Webhooks?

- ✅ **Real-time notifications** - Get instant updates when zips complete
- ✅ **Reduce API calls** - No need to poll the status endpoint repeatedly
- ✅ **Better user experience** - Respond immediately to completed zips
- ✅ **Reliable delivery** - Webhooks are sent as soon as the job completes

## Configuring Webhooks

Webhooks are configured through the ZipKit dashboard for your project.

### Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Webhooks">
    1. Log in to your ZipKit dashboard
    2. Select your project
    3. Go to the "Webhooks" section
    4. Click "Create Webhook" or "New Webhook"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the webhook">
    **URL (Required)**
    Enter the full HTTPS URL where you want to receive webhook notifications.
    Example: `https://api.myapp.com/webhooks/zipkit`

    **Description (Optional)**
    Add a description to help identify this webhook's purpose.
    Example: "Production webhook for zip completion events"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and test">
    1. Click "Save" or "Create"
    2. Your webhook will now receive notifications for all zip jobs in this project
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **HTTPS Required**: For security, webhook URLs must use HTTPS (not HTTP). This ensures webhook payloads are encrypted in transit.
</Note>

## Webhook Payload

When a zip completes (successfully or with failure), ZipKit sends a POST request to your webhook URL with the following JSON payload:

### Successful Zip

```json
{
  "type": "COMPLETED",
  "zip_id": "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "bucket": {
    "service": "s3",
    "name": "my-destination-bucket"
  },
  "key": "reports/monthly-2025-11.zip",
  "checksum": "d8e8fca2dc0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249",
  "byte_size": 0,
  "content_type": "application/zip, application/octet-stream",
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "order_id": "order_456"
  }
}
```

### Failed Zip

```json

```

## Payload Fields

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  The event type. Currently always `"COMPLETED"`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="zip_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier (UUID) of the zip job. This matches the `id` returned when you created the zip.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  The final status of the zip job. This is always a string value.

  **Possible values:**
  - `"succeeded"` - zip was created and uploaded successfully
  - `"failed"` - zip creation or upload failed
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bucket" type="object">
  Information about the destination bucket.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bucket.service" type="string">
  The cloud storage service (`"s3"` or `"r2"`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bucket.name" type="string">
  The name of the bucket where the zip was stored (or attempted to be stored).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string">
  The storage key (filename/path) of the zip archive in the bucket.
</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

## Implementing a Webhook Endpoint

Your webhook endpoint should:

1. **Accept POST requests** with JSON payloads
2. **Respond quickly** (within 5-10 seconds)
3. **Return a 2xx status code** to acknowledge receipt
4. **Verify the webhook source** (optional but recommended)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond quickly" icon="bolt">
    Your endpoint should respond within 5-10 seconds. If you need to perform long-running tasks, process them asynchronously in a background job.

    ```python
    @app.route('/webhooks/zipkit', methods=['POST'])
    def zipkit_webhook():
        payload = request.json

        # Queue for background processing
        celery.send_task('process_zip', args=[payload])

        # Respond immediately
        return jsonify({'received': True}), 200
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify webhook authenticity" icon="shield-check">
    Since webhooks don't currently include authentication headers, verify requests by:
    - Restricting webhook endpoint access to ZipKit's IP addresses
    - Using HTTPS to ensure requests aren't intercepted
    - Validating the webhook payload structure and data types
    - Implementing request signing (future feature)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle retries gracefully" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Make your webhook endpoint idempotent. ZipKit may retry sending webhooks if your endpoint fails to respond. Use the `zip_id` to deduplicate events.

    ```python
    # Check if we've already processed this zip
    if already_processed(payload['zip_id']):
        return jsonify({'received': True}), 200

    # Process the webhook
    process_webhook(payload)
    mark_as_processed(payload['zip_id'])
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Log webhook receipts" icon="file-lines">
    Log all webhook receipts for debugging and auditing purposes.

    ```python
    import logging

    logger.info(f"Received webhook for zip {zip_id}: {status}")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Return proper status codes" icon="check">
    - Return `200` or `204` for successful receipt
    - Return `401` for authentication failures
    - Return `500` only for actual server errors

    ZipKit considers 2xx responses as successful delivery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS with valid certificates" icon="lock">
    Ensure your webhook endpoint uses HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate. Self-signed certificates may cause delivery failures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Webhooks

### Local Development

For testing webhooks locally, use tools like:

- **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** - Creates a public URL for your local server
- **[localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/)** - Alternative tunneling service
- **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)** - Inspect webhook payloads

**Example with ngrok:**

```bash
# Start your local server
python app.py  # Running on port 5000

# In another terminal, create a tunnel
ngrok http 5000

# Use the ngrok HTTPS URL in ZipKit
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/zipkit
```

### Production Testing

Create a test webhook that logs all received payloads to verify everything works correctly before going live.

## Managing Webhooks

### Viewing Webhooks

All configured webhooks are listed in your project's "Webhooks" section, showing:
- Webhook URL
- Description
- Creation date

**Security:** The Authorization header is never displayed after creation.

### Editing Webhooks

To update a webhook:
1. Go to "Webhooks" section
2. Click "Edit" next to the webhook
3. Update the URL, description, or authorization header
4. Save changes

### Deleting Webhooks

To remove a webhook:
1. Go to "Webhooks" section
2. Click "Delete" next to the webhook
3. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Once deleted, you'll stop receiving notifications for zip completions. Any in-flight webhooks may still be delivered.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving webhooks

**Possible causes:**
- Webhook URL is incorrect or unreachable
- Your server is blocking requests from ZipKit
- SSL certificate issues (expired or self-signed)
- Firewall blocking incoming requests

**Solutions:**
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check server logs for incoming requests
- Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
- Test with webhook.site first to verify ZipKit is sending requests

### Receiving duplicate webhooks

This can happen if:
- Your endpoint took too long to respond
- Your endpoint returned an error status code
- Network issues caused ZipKit to retry

**Solution:** Make your webhook handler idempotent using the `zip_id` to deduplicate.

### Securing webhook endpoints

**Best practices:**
- Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Restrict access to your webhook endpoint by IP address
- Validate the structure and content of webhook payloads
- Log all webhook receipts for monitoring

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  **Webhook Security**: Anyone who knows your webhook URL could potentially send fake webhook requests. Secure your webhook endpoint appropriately.
</Warning>

Best practices:
- ✅ Use HTTPS to encrypt webhook payloads in transit
- ✅ Restrict access to your webhook endpoint by IP address
- ✅ Validate the webhook payload structure and data types
- ✅ Use unique, hard-to-guess webhook URLs
- ✅ Log all webhook receipts for monitoring
- ✅ Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries

## Multiple Webhooks

You can configure multiple webhook URLs in a single project for:

- Different endpoints for different environments
- Redundancy (send to multiple systems)
- Different services that need to be notified

All configured webhooks will receive notifications for every zip completion in the project.
