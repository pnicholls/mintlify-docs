## Overview

ZIPs are the core of ZipKit - they represent jobs that fetch files from remote URLs, bundle them into a ZIP archive, and store the result in your cloud storage bucket.

## How ZIP Creation Works

When you create a ZIP, ZipKit performs these steps asynchronously:

1. **Validates** your request (bucket exists, URLs are valid)
2. **Downloads** each file from the provided URLs
3. **Creates** a ZIP archive containing all downloaded files
4. **Uploads** the ZIP to your configured cloud storage bucket
5. **Sends** a webhook notification (if configured)

The entire process is asynchronous - the API returns immediately with a ZIP ID, and processing happens in the background.

## ZIP Lifecycle

A ZIP job progresses through these statuses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="none">
    Initial state when the ZIP is first created. The job is queued but hasn't started processing yet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="processing">
    ZipKit is actively downloading files and creating the ZIP archive. This is where most of the work happens.
  </Step>

  <Step title="succeeded">
    The ZIP was successfully created and uploaded to your bucket. The file is ready to use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="failed">
    Something went wrong during processing. Common causes include inaccessible URLs or bucket permission issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a ZIP

Create a ZIP via the API by providing:

- **urls**: Array of file URLs to include in the ZIP
- **bucket_name**: Name of the configured bucket to store the ZIP
- **key** (optional): Custom filename/path for the ZIP
- **service** (optional): `s3` or `r2` (defaults to `s3`)

```bash
curl -X POST https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": [
      "https://example.com/file1.pdf",
      "https://example.com/file2.jpg"
    ],
    "bucket_name": "my-bucket",
    "key": "my-archive.zip"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc",
    "status": "none"
  }
}
```

## Tracking Progress

Configure a webhook URL in your project settings to receive automatic notifications when ZIPs complete:

```json
{
  "type": "COMPLETED",
  "zip_id": "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "bucket": {
    "service": "s3",
    "name": "my-bucket"
  },
  "key": "my-archive.zip"
}
```

See [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks) for complete webhook documentation.

## Where ZIPs are Stored

When a ZIP completes successfully, it's stored in your configured cloud storage bucket.

**If you provided a `key` parameter:**

The ZIP is stored at that exact location:
```
my-bucket/my-archive.zip
```

**If you didn't provide a `key`:**

ZipKit auto-generates a filename:
```
my-bucket/zip_clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc.zip
```

You can then access the ZIP file using your cloud provider's SDK, console, or direct URL.

## File Naming Inside ZIPs

Files inside the ZIP archive are named based on their source URLs:

- `https://example.com/documents/report.pdf` → `report.pdf`
- `https://example.com/images/photo.jpg` → `photo.jpg`

The filename is extracted from the URL path. Use descriptive filenames in your source URLs for better organization.

## Common Patterns

### One-Time Archives

Create a ZIP once for a specific set of files:

```bash
{
  "urls": ["https://example.com/invoice.pdf"],
  "bucket_name": "invoices",
  "key": "invoice-12345.zip"
}
```

### Recurring Archives

Create ZIPs on a schedule (e.g., daily reports):

```bash
{
  "urls": ["https://example.com/reports/daily-2025-11-16.csv"],
  "bucket_name": "reports",
  "key": "reports/daily-2025-11-16.zip"
}
```

### Dynamic Content

Fetch the latest files from a content system and bundle them:

```bash
{
  "urls": [
    "https://cms.example.com/latest/article.html",
    "https://cms.example.com/latest/images/header.jpg"
  ],
  "bucket_name": "archives",
  "key": "content/latest.zip"
}
```

## Managing ZIPs

### Viewing ZIPs

View all ZIP jobs for a project in the dashboard. The ZIP list shows:
- ZIP ID (masked)
- Status
- Creation date
- Bucket used

### Failed ZIPs

If a ZIP fails, common causes include:

- **Inaccessible URLs**: Source files returned 404 or other errors
- **Network issues**: Timeouts or connection failures
- **Bucket permissions**: Insufficient permissions to write to the bucket
- **Invalid bucket**: Bucket doesn't exist or was deleted

Check the status and retry with corrected parameters if needed.
