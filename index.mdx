## What is ZipKit?

ZipKit is a powerful API that fetches files from the URLs you provide, bundles them into a single ZIP archive, and stores the result in your cloud storage bucket (S3 or R2). When the ZIP is ready, ZipKit sends a webhook notification so your system knows as soon as it’s ready.

**Key Features:**

- 🚀 **Simple REST API** - Create ZIPs with a single API call
- ☁️ **Your cloud storage** - ZIPs are stored in your own S3 or R2 buckets
- 🔔 **Webhook notifications** - Get instant alerts when ZIPs are ready
- 🔒 **Secure** - All requests use HTTPS and bearer token authentication
- ⚡ **Fast & scalable** - Handles large files and multiple concurrent jobs

## Common Use Cases

- **Document Processing** - Bundle multiple documents (PDFs, Word files, spreadsheets) into a single downloadable archive for users
- **Image Galleries** - Create ZIP archives of photo collections for easy download
- **Backup & Export** - Generate ZIP exports of user data for compliance or data portability
- **Report Distribution** - Combine multiple report files into a single archive for distribution
- **Asset Delivery** - Package design assets, code files, or resources for delivery to clients

## How It Works

1. **Configure** your cloud storage bucket (S3 or R2) in the ZipKit dashboard
2. **Create** an access token for API authentication
3. **Send** a POST request with URLs of files to bundle
4. **Receive** a webhook when the ZIP is ready in your bucket
5. **Download** or share the ZIP from your cloud storage
