title: "Get ZIP Status"
description: "Check the status of a ZIP archive creation job"
api: "GET /api/v1/zips/:id"
---

## Overview

The Get ZIP endpoint allows you to check the current status of a ZIP creation job. Since ZIP creation is asynchronous, you can use this endpoint to poll for updates or verify completion.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/zips/:id
```

## Authentication

Requires a valid access token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier (UUID) of the ZIP job. This is returned when you [create a ZIP](/api-reference/create-zip).
</ParamField>

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips/clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

```python Python
import requests

zip_id = "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc"
url = f"https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips/{zip_id}"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-access-token"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
zip_data = response.json()

print(f"Status: {zip_data['data']['status']}")
```

```javascript JavaScript
const zipId = 'clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc';
const response = await fetch(`https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips/${zipId}`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-access-token'
  }
});

const zipData = await response.json();
console.log(`Status: ${zipData.data.status}`);
```

```ruby Ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

zip_id = 'clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc'
uri = URI("https://zipkit.io/api/v1/zips/#{zip_id}")
http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
http.use_ssl = true

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.path, {
  'Authorization' => 'Bearer your-access-token'
})

response = http.request(request)
zip_data = JSON.parse(response.body)
puts "Status: #{zip_data['data']['status']}"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc",
    "status": "succeeded"
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  The response data object containing ZIP information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data.id" type="string">
  The unique identifier (UUID) for this ZIP job.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data.status" type="string">
  Current status of the ZIP job.

  **Possible values:**
  - `none` - Job created, not yet started processing
  - `processing` - Currently downloading files and creating ZIP
  - `succeeded` - ZIP successfully created and uploaded to your bucket
  - `failed` - Job failed during processing
</ResponseField>

## Status Lifecycle

A ZIP job progresses through these statuses:

1. **`none`** - Initial state when the job is first created
2. **`processing`** - ZipKit is downloading files and creating the ZIP archive
3. **`succeeded`** or **`failed`** - Final state

Once a ZIP reaches `succeeded` or `failed`, the status won't change further.

## Polling Best Practices

If you need to poll for status updates:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use exponential backoff" icon="clock">
    Start with short intervals (e.g., 1 second) and gradually increase the delay between requests (e.g., 2s, 4s, 8s) to reduce unnecessary API calls.

    ```python
    import time

    max_attempts = 10
    delay = 1

    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        status = response.json()['data']['status']

        if status in ['succeeded', 'failed']:
            break

        time.sleep(delay)
        delay = min(delay * 2, 30)  # Cap at 30 seconds
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set a timeout" icon="timer">
    Don't poll indefinitely. Set a reasonable maximum number of attempts or total time limit based on your expected ZIP sizes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle terminal states" icon="flag-checkered">
    Stop polling once you receive `succeeded` or `failed` status. These are final states that won't change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider using webhooks instead" icon="webhook">
    For a better experience, configure [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks) to receive automatic notifications when ZIPs complete, eliminating the need to poll.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when authentication fails.

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing access token"
}
```

**Solution**: Check that you're including a valid `Authorization` header.

### 404 Not Found

Returned when the ZIP ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to your project.

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "ZIP not found"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify the ZIP ID is correct and belongs to your project.

## What to Do After Success

Once the status is `succeeded`, your ZIP file is ready in your configured cloud storage bucket:

1. **Locate the file**: The ZIP will be at the `key` you specified (or auto-generated as `zip_{UUID}.zip`)
2. **Access the file**: Use your cloud provider's SDK or console to download or share the ZIP
3. **Process the file**: Your application can now download and use the ZIP archive

## Handling Failures

If the status is `failed`, the ZIP creation encountered an error. Common causes:

- Source URLs were inaccessible (404, timeout, etc.)
- Network issues during file download
- Insufficient permissions to write to the destination bucket
- Invalid bucket configuration

**Next steps:**
- Verify all source URLs are accessible
- Check your bucket configuration and credentials
- Try creating a new ZIP job with corrected parameters
