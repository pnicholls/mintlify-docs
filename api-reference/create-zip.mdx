title: "Create ZIP"
description: "Create a new ZIP archive from remote files"
api: "POST /api/v1/zips"
---

## Overview

The Create ZIP endpoint accepts a list of URLs pointing to remote files, downloads them, bundles them into a ZIP archive, and uploads the result to your configured cloud storage bucket.

ZIP creation is **asynchronous** - the endpoint returns immediately with a job ID, and the actual processing happens in the background.

## Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/zips
```

## Authentication

Requires a valid access token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="urls" type="array" required>
  An array of URLs pointing to files you want to include in the ZIP archive. Each URL must be publicly accessible or return the file when requested.

  **Requirements:**
  - At least 1 URL required
  - Each URL must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL
  - Files will be downloaded and included in the ZIP in the order provided
  - Filenames in the ZIP will be extracted from the URL path (e.g., `https://example.com/documents/report.pdf` becomes `report.pdf`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="bucket_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the S3 or R2 bucket where the ZIP archive will be stored. This must match a bucket you've configured in your project settings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="key" type="string" optional>
  The filename for the ZIP archive in your bucket. If not provided, ZipKit will generate a filename based on the ZIP's UUID (e.g., `zip_{uuid}.zip`).

  **Example:** `"reports/monthly-report-2025-11.zip"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="service" type="string" optional>
  The cloud storage service to use. Defaults to `"s3"` if not specified.

  **Options:**
  - `"s3"` - AWS S3 (default)
  - `"r2"` - Cloudflare R2
</ParamField>

## Response

### Success Response (201 Created)

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc",
    "status": "none"
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  The response data object containing ZIP information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data.id" type="string">
  Unique identifier (UUID) for this ZIP job. Use this to check status later via the [Get ZIP](/api-reference/get-zip) endpoint.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data.status" type="string">
  Current status of the ZIP job. Will be `"none"` when first created.

  **Possible values:**
  - `none` - Job created, not yet started processing
  - `processing` - Currently downloading files and creating ZIP
  - `succeeded` - ZIP successfully created and uploaded to your bucket
  - `failed` - Job failed during processing
</ResponseField>

## ZIP Creation Process

After you create a ZIP job, ZipKit performs these steps asynchronously:

1. **Validates** the bucket ID and URLs
2. **Downloads** each file from the provided URLs
3. **Creates** a ZIP archive containing all downloaded files
4. **Uploads** the ZIP to your configured cloud storage bucket
5. **Sends** a webhook notification (if configured)

The entire process typically takes a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on:
- Number of files
- Size of files
- Network speed when downloading from source URLs
- Upload speed to your cloud storage

## Checking Status

The Create ZIP endpoint returns immediately - it doesn't wait for the ZIP to be created. To check the status:

1. **Poll the status endpoint**: Use the [Get ZIP Status](/api-reference/get-zip) endpoint with the returned `id`
2. **Use webhooks (recommended)**: Configure a webhook to receive automatic notifications when the ZIP completes

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request

Returned when the request is invalid.

```json
{
  "error": "bad_request",
  "message": "urls is required and must be an array",
  "details": {
    "urls": ["can't be blank"]
  }
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing required fields (`bucket_id` or `urls`)
- `urls` is not an array
- `urls` array is empty
- Invalid URL format

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when authentication fails.

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing access token"
}
```

**Solution**: Check that you're including a valid `Authorization` header.

### 404 Not Found

Returned when the specified bucket doesn't exist or doesn't belong to your project.

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "message": "Bucket not found"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify the `bucket_name` matches a bucket you've configured in your project.

### 422 Unprocessable Entity

Returned when the request is well-formed but contains invalid data.

```json
{
  "error": "unprocessable_entity",
  "message": "Invalid webhook URL format"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Invalid webhook URL format
- URLs that aren't accessible
- Invalid bucket configuration

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Validate URLs before sending" icon="check">
    Make sure all URLs are accessible and return the expected files. ZipKit will attempt to download from each URL - if a URL is inaccessible, the ZIP job may fail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive keys" icon="file">
    Specify a meaningful `key` parameter to organize your ZIPs in your bucket (e.g., `"reports/monthly-2025-11.zip"` instead of letting ZipKit auto-generate one).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider file sizes" icon="database">
    Very large files or many files can take longer to process. Monitor the status endpoint to track progress.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive filenames in source URLs" icon="tag">
    The filenames inside the ZIP will be extracted from the URL paths. Use descriptive filenames in your source URLs (e.g., `report-2025-11.pdf` instead of `file.pdf`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configure buckets properly" icon="bucket">
    Ensure your destination bucket exists and has proper write permissions for the credentials configured in your project.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## ZIP File Location

When the ZIP is complete, it will be stored in your specified bucket.

**If you provided a `key` parameter:**
The ZIP will be stored at exactly that key in your bucket.
```
my-bucket/reports/monthly-2025-11.zip
```

**If you didn't provide a `key` parameter:**
ZipKit will auto-generate a filename based on the ZIP's UUID:
```
zip_{UUID}.zip
```

For example: `zip_clx7g2m4p0000xyz123abc.zip`

You can then access the file using your cloud storage provider's SDK, console, or direct URL.
